<h1> The Best Movies Acording to Amy <h1>
    <h2> My top 3 movies off all-time</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3> The Greatest Showman </h3>
    <p> 
        I love this movie, it's about innovation and how to build a good team, coupled with a story of family love and never losing sight of what you really want. </p>
    <h3> Confessions of a Shopaholic</h3>
    <p> It is a film about fashion, debt, finance and love. I like this movie too much because it mixes examples of finance with fashion, and these are two topics that are of interest to me, coupled with a romantic story.</p>
    <h3> The choice</h3>
    <p> It's a movie about decisions and taking risks when it comes to love, it motivates you to take certain risks when love is worth it. </p>
